# Geo-Explore
A short little game where the player has to grab all the coins in the level with the least amount of deaths.

#About
This game is a proof of concept of the 2d platformer capabilities with Arcade in python. It utilises sprite collision mechanics as the core component of the game. The objective is piloting a little square character collecting coins in a seemingly idyllic world, filled with 'enemies' which will send you back to the start, no questions asked.
